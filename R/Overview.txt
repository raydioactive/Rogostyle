Package purpose is to take large latin text strings, split them into chunks of a predetermined size, and pass that list of chunks to the latinbert
The resulting embeddings are to be stored in a style object, a matrix that contains all the CLTK information


TODO:
- make a function to process text and generate a cltk_object
--  make a function that preprocesses text for latinBERT
- make a superobject that holds multiple CLTK_docs
- make a function that chunks the raw text of the cltk_doc into equally sized chunks of n tokens, stores in a chunks subobject
- make a function that applies latinBERT to the
